*Poecilia sulphuraria*, also known as sulphur mollies, are a variety of fish, highly endemic to some sulphide spring complexes in Mexico, being discovered in *Ba√±os del Azufre*, which literally translates to "Sulphur Baths" in Spanish. 
These small extremophiles which can grow up to 12 cm, are used to these $H_{2}S$-rich waters, in which they can be found in high abundance and density **[1]**.

Due to water's low oxygen content, mollies gather at the surface to be able to breath air. For avian predators, that is a perfect scenario, in which they can spot their preys easily and pull them out of the water without having to dive inside the sulphide springs. These mollies have developed a remarkable collective antipredator behavior, based on high density of its kind and "trust" in their school of fish and their neighbors.
    
Once a molly detects an anomaly in its surroundings (very well may be spotting a bird or another animal going around them, or just a leaf falling on top of the water), they will dive into safety. Surrounding mollies will follow, forming "fish waves" that can be very visible from the surface, and expand acroos the pond. Sometimes this dives are just random, or are not due to a specific threat, and mollies will also follow their partners. These waves also produces some visual effect on the predators, which are discouraged to go into the water since a bigger predator producing these waves could be hiding in them **[2]**.
